Zodiac is a testing framework built on Nose. The goals of this design strategy are to encourage reusable code, be flexible, and to be maintainable. The design patterns used in Zodiac allow for both JSON and XML testing of REST services. In addition, multiple API definitions can be made in a single project, allowing for integration testing between services. The service tier also allows other structures such as performance, load, and fuzz tests to be created and run. 
level directory.

To configure:
You'll need to modify the zodiac.cfg file with data relevant to your
configuration. Aside from relevant flavors and images in your Nova environment, Zodiac also supports basic Nova authentication or Keystone authentication. 

To run all tests: "nosetests" from the root directory
To run proper subsets of tests, use the -a argument with the desired tag.
To run a single test class, run nosetests zodiac/tests/<name of test file>
I'll also been using the -sv flag for more interactive output.

Still pending:
XML requests and responses (servers client done, still working on others)
Multithreaded execution
More options for configuration other than flat text file
